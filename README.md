# Project Overview
In this case study, I analyzed customer data from Aerofit, a leading fitness equipment brand, to help understand which types of customers purchase different treadmill models. The objective was to develop data-driven customer profiles for each treadmill product and derive actionable marketing and product recommendations.

# Business Problem

Aerofit wants to better understand the characteristics of customers purchasing each treadmill model (KP281, KP481, KP781). This will help the company recommend the right product to new customers and improve marketing targeting. The study focuses on analyzing demographic and usage features and calculating conditional probabilities for deeper insights.

# Approach & Analysis

Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Explored dataset shape (180 rows Ã— 9 columns), data types, and converted categorical attributes where needed.

Checked for missing values and outliers using boxplots and descriptive statistics.

Descriptive Analysis:

Analyzed customer age, income, usage, fitness rating, and expected miles per week.

Examined distributions by product, gender, marital status, and education level.

Probability Analysis:

Created two-way contingency tables to analyze relationships (e.g., product vs. gender).

Computed marginal and conditional probabilities, such as the probability of a male customer buying the KP781 treadmill.

Correlation Analysis:

Visualized correlations using heatmaps and pair plots to identify relationships between numerical features like income, age, and fitness.

Customer Profiling:

Identified distinct segments for each treadmill type (e.g., high-income fitness enthusiasts for KP781).

Categorized customers based on usage frequency and fitness self-rating.

# Business Insights

KP281 is more popular among entry-level users and customers with lower fitness ratings and incomes.

KP781 attracts high-income, higher-fitness-rating customers, often planning to use the treadmill more frequently and run longer distances.

Gender and marital status show patterns; for example, partnered customers are more likely to buy higher-end models.

Younger, higher-income customers are more likely to invest in advanced treadmills.
